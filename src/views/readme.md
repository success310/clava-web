# UI

In the UI we divide by 3 types:

- [Components](./components/readme.md): Small UI React components, used throughout the whole Project, f.e. Header, Image ...
- [Navigation](./navigation/readme.md): React components that handle navigator changes, The WEB version contains of just a single navigator `Main`, may be extended in the future
- [Screens](./screens/readme.md): React components covering the whole screen

Currently, there's a mess with the Adminpanel (Backoffice), deserves its own navigator.
